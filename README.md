# SOLIDITY BASICS
The project uses the basics of solidity to create a simple calculator that add, subtracts, multiply and divide a certain number. Variable and functions are mostly used in the project

**NOTE:**<br>
It is prefared to run the code on the remix ide. This IDE is favorouble for solidity programmes. You can actually run the programe with VScode, but that will be a complex process than using the remix IDE.
